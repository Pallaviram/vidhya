the name of this restautant really goes with the quality of the food and the taste or i can say worst than road
side food.dining area itself looks pathetic not sure how good is the kitchen.the plates and spoons provided was not
even washed properly when we asked him to change it he landed up those plates and spones to the next table.
we ordered for chinese food,i believe we ware running out of luck starters served was like cooked by a person.
